Getting Started

1) Open a free OnShape account if you don't have one yet (https://onshape.com).
2) Launch a new OnShape document.
3) In the bottom-left corner, click '+' -> Create Feature Studio.
4) A new tab will appear in the bottom tab panel called 'Feature Studio 1'.
5) Right-click the 'Feature Studio 1' tab and rename it 'LBEASTWallFrameCreator'.
6) Repeat steps 4 & 5 to create new tabs for 'LBEASTWallUtil' and 'LBEASTWallComponents'
7) Paste the contents of each of those three files from the LBEAST_OnShape repo and click 'Commit' for each.
8) LBEASTWallFrameCreator imports the other two. Since you just created fresh copies of each file, the imports will fail until you reference those new file IDs. Copy the number at the end of the URL for 'LBEASTWallUtil' and paste it into the import line in LBEASTWallFrameCreator:

import(path : "1a352bc5f15cd57be34e8ae2", version : "2d512763c2cdc696a8563fb5");
	      [^ PASTE YOUR FILE ID HERE]	    [^ ONSHAPE AUTOGENERATES W/ YOUR FILE ID]

9) Copy the ID at the end of the URL for 'LBEASTWallComponents' and paste it into the appropriate import line in 'LBEASTWallFrameCreator' (like in step 8).
